Ives joins Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to discuss his view that Apple will be the first US stock to reach the $4 trillion mark, followed by Nvidia and Microsoft. Apple’s “AI-driven supercycle that starts with iPhone 16 is going to start in the December quarter as more Apple Intelligence gets rolled out. We think 20% of the world's population will access AI through Apple through an Apple device. And this is something as this all plays out next three to six months, I believe this will be a historical year for iPhone units above 240 million.\" “What we see right now is, actually, this is going to be a 2025 event. Now, you could argue it's a multi-year supercycle as it all plays out. But you have 300 million iPhones that haven't upgraded in four-plus years. You have a pent-up upgrade opportunity that's unprecedented. And that's why I think we're looking the first to hit $4 trillion will be Cook and Cupertino followed by Godfather of AI, Jensen[‘s] Nvidia, and then Microsoft in mid-2025.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

      "Summary: Tesla (TSLA) is set to kick off the \"Magnificent Seven\" earnings reports next week for the third quarter. But how can investors gain exposure to these megacap tech names without buying individual stocks? Calamos Investments senior vice president and head of ETFs Matt Kaufman joins Yahoo Finance to discuss investing strategies. Kaufman points out that the Magnificent Seven trade continues to drive strong market returns, with the group up 40% this year. He notes, \"The Mag Seven is still accounting for a significant portion\" of market gains, even as the other 493 S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies are starting to gain momentum. \"If the leadership in the Mag 7 stops continuing going forward, maybe the innovation doesn't keep up at the same pace, then you would want exposure to those other names as well,\" Kaufman advises. He suggests investors consider CANQ (CANQ), an ETF that provides exposure to top names using options to remain defensive. \"We're seeing a lot of folks moving into this options-based strategy, which really allows you to control the exposure you want to these Mag 7 names and to others,\" Kaufman explains.
